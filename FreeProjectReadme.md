#### My Project idea ####
<h6> I want to make for my free project a Genetive art code that rejects on a arduino sector. I really want to do this, because I love to make colorfull and choastic things and I think it is really awesome when it is interactive. </h6>

#### Genetive art  ####

<h6>Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist **uses a system**, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.<h6>

#### Arduino ####

<h6> I want to use arduino sensors so that you can change with you hands my generative art code on screen. I think it will give a very nice interaction between the player and the awesome code. </h6>

<h6> I want to use the motion sensor that you can buy for the arduino. I am very exciting if I can make it work, because I never work with it before. But I love to try </h6>
